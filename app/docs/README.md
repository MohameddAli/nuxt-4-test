# App Docs

This folder holds project-specific documentation that is close to the code (design notes, UX flows, ADRs, glossary). Use it to document features and decisions that affect components, pages, and stores.

Recommended structure:
- architecture.md: high-level diagrams and decisions
- i18n.md: translation guidelines and key conventions
- ui.md: UI patterns and Vuetify usage notes
