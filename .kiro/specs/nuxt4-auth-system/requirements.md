# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a simple and practical Nuxt 4 authentication system that provides essential authentication functionality without unnecessary complexity. The system will be a clean, maintainable foundation for TypeScript-based Nuxt 4 applications with basic authentication and role-based access control.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Simple Authentication System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a straightforward authentication system that handles login, logout, and token management without complex configurations, so that I can focus on building my application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL store the access token securely
2. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear all authentication data
3. WHEN a token expires THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to login
4. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL automatically include the authentication token
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages

### Requirement 2: Clean State Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want authentication state managed through Pinia stores with simple composables, so that I have a consistent and predictable way to handle authentication throughout my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using authentication THEN the system SHALL use Pinia stores for state management
2. WHEN accessing auth state THEN composables SHALL provide a clean API
3. WHEN state changes THEN all components SHALL react automatically
4. WHEN the app initializes THEN authentication state SHALL be restored from storage

### Requirement 3: Route Protection and Authorization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to protect routes based on authentication status and user roles, so that I can control access to different parts of my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page for protected routes
2. WHEN a user is authenticated but lacks required permissions THEN the system SHALL redirect them to an unauthorized page
3. WHEN defining route protection THEN developers SHALL be able to specify required roles using page meta
4. WHEN implementing RBAC THEN the system SHALL support both role-based and permission-based access control
5. WHEN middleware runs THEN it SHALL check authentication status and permissions before allowing route access

### Requirement 4: TypeScript Integration

**User Story:** As a TypeScript developer, I want full type safety for authentication-related data structures, so that I can catch errors at compile time and have better IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining user data THEN the system SHALL provide TypeScript interfaces for User, AuthTokens, and AuthState
2. WHEN making API calls THEN all authentication-related functions SHALL have proper type annotations
3. WHEN using composables or stores THEN they SHALL provide full TypeScript intellisense and type checking
4. WHEN handling authentication responses THEN the system SHALL validate response types at runtime where possible

### Requirement 5: SSR Compatibility

**User Story:** As a Nuxt developer, I want authentication to work seamlessly with server-side rendering, so that my application provides optimal performance and SEO.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application renders on the server THEN authentication state SHALL be properly hydrated on the client
2. WHEN using useState or Pinia THEN the authentication state SHALL persist across SSR boundaries
3. WHEN implementing token storage THEN it SHALL handle client-side only operations safely
4. WHEN middleware runs THEN it SHALL work correctly in both server and client contexts

### Requirement 6: Security Best Practices

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the authentication system to follow security best practices, so that my application is protected against common vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing sensitive tokens THEN the system SHALL avoid localStorage for access tokens in production
2. WHEN implementing refresh tokens THEN they SHALL be stored securely (httpOnly cookies preferred)
3. WHEN handling API errors THEN the system SHALL properly clear authentication state on 401 responses
4. WHEN implementing logout THEN the system SHALL clear all client-side authentication data
5. WHEN using cookies THEN they SHALL be configured with appropriate security flags (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)

### Requirement 7: Development Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear examples and documentation for each authentication approach, so that I can quickly understand and implement the patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning the system THEN each approach SHALL have complete working examples
2. WHEN implementing authentication THEN developers SHALL have access to reusable composables and utilities
3. WHEN debugging authentication issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and logging
4. WHEN switching between modes THEN configuration changes SHALL be minimal and well-documented
5. WHEN extending the system THEN the architecture SHALL support easy customization and additional features
