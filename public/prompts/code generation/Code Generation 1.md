Generate a Function:
Generate a [language] function named “[function name]” that:
1. Accepts the following parameters: “[parameter name 1 (type)]“, “[parameter name 2 (type)]“.
2. Performs the following logic: “[describe detailed logic and purpose]“.
3. Returns “[return type and description of what it returns]“.
[Optional: Add constraints like "Ensure it handles edge cases like [edge case 1], [edge case 2]."]
[Optional: "Use [specific library or idiom] if appropriate."]

----------------------------------------------

Generate a Class/Object Structure:
Create a [language] class named “[ClassName]” to represent “[concept the class represents]“.
It should have the following:
1. Properties:
– “[property name 1 (type)]“: “[description of property 1]”
– “[property name 2 (type)]“: “[description of property 2]”
2. Methods:
– “[method name 1(parameters)]“: “[description of method 1 purpose and logic]”
– “[method name 2(parameters)]“: “[description of method 2 purpose and logic]”
[Optional: "Include a constructor that initializes [specific properties]."]
[Optional: "Implement [specific design pattern like singleton or factory method]."]

----------------------------------------------

Write a Script/Program:
Write a [language] script that performs the following task: “[detailed description of the script's overall goal]“.
The script should:
1. “[Step 1: e.g., Read data from a file named [filename.ext]]”
2. “[Step 2: e.g., Process the data by [specific processing logic]]”
3. “[Step 3: e.g., Output the result to [console/new file.ext] in [specific format like JSON or CSV]]”
[Optional: "The script should handle potential errors like [error type 1] and [error type 2]."]
[Optional: "It should take command-line arguments for [argument 1 purpose] and [argument 2 purpose]."]

----------------------------------------------

Implement an Algorithm:
Implement the “[algorithm name]” algorithm in “[language]” to “[purpose of the algorithm in this context, e.g., sort a list of numbers]“.
The function should take “[input description, e.g., a list of integers]” and return “[output description, e.g., a new sorted list]“.
Provide the code and a brief explanation of how it implements the algorithm.
