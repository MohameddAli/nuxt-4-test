Generate Coding Interview Problem:
Generate a “[difficulty level e.g., easy, medium, hard]” coding interview problem suitable for a “[language]” developer.
The problem should focus on “[topic e.g., arrays and strings, linked lists, trees and graphs, sorting and searching, dynamic programming, recursion]“.
Please provide:
1. A clear problem statement.
2. At least one example input and its corresponding expected output.
3. An optimal or well-reasoned solution in “[language]“.
4. A step-by-step explanation of the solution’s logic.
5. An analysis of the time and space complexity of the provided solution.

----------------------------------------------

Explain Common Interview Concepts/Question Types:
What are some common conceptual questions or typical coding task types related to “[specific topic or data structure e.g., hash maps in Java, Python list comprehensions and generators, JavaScript closures and scope, Big O notation, common sorting algorithms analysis]” that are often asked in “[language or general software engineer]” coding interviews?
For each, briefly outline the key points to understand, discuss, or demonstrate.
