My Standard Prompt for Code Generation
Here's my go-to template for requesting code:


I need to implement [specific functionality] in [programming language].
Key requirements:
1. [Requirement 1]
2. [Requirement 2]
3. [Requirement 3]
Please consider:
- Error handling
- Edge cases
- Performance optimization
- Best practices for [language/framework]
Please do not unnecessarily remove any comments or code.
Generate the code with clear comments explaining the logic.

Reviewing and Understanding AI-Generated Code
Never, ever blindly copy-paste AI-generated code into your project. Ask for an explanation first. Trust me. This will save you considerable debugging time and you will also learn a thing or two in the process.

Here's a prompt I use for getting explanations:


Can you explain the following part of the code in detail:
[paste code section]
Specifically:
1. What is the purpose of this section?
2. How does it work step-by-step?
3. Are there any potential issues or limitations with this approach?

----------------------------------------------


Using AI for Code Reviews and Improvements
AI is great for catching issues you might miss and suggesting improvements.

Try this prompt for code review:


Please review the following code:
[paste your code]
Consider:
1. Code quality and adherence to best practices
2. Potential bugs or edge cases
3. Performance optimizations
4. Readability and maintainability
5. Any security concerns
Suggest improvements and explain your reasoning for each suggestion.
