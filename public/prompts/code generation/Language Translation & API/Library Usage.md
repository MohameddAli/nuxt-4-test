[paste source code snippet]
Ensure the translated code maintains the original logic and functionality.
Point out any significant differences in idioms, standard library usage, or potential pitfalls during translation.

Using a Library/API:
How do I use the “[library or API name]” in “[language]” to “[specific task e.g., make a GET request to an endpoint, parse a JSON file, connect to a database]“?
Provide a clear code example demonstrating how to:
1. “[Step 1: e.g., Import necessary modules/Install the library]”
2. “[Step 2: e.g., Initialize the client or set up parameters, including authentication like [API key/OAuth token] if needed]”
3. “[Step 3: e.g., Execute the main action, like calling [specific API endpoint] or [library function]]”
4. “[Step 4: e.g., Handle the response (e.g., parse [JSON/XML data], extract [specific fields]) or errors (e.g., handle [HTTP status code 401/429])]”
[Optional: "Assume I have already installed [library name] and its dependencies."]
