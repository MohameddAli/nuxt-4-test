Explain a Design Pattern:
Explain the “[design pattern name e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer]” design pattern in the context of “[language]“.
Describe its purpose, structure (key components/roles), common use cases, pros, and cons.
Provide a clear and concise code example demonstrating its implementation.

----------------------------------------------

Choose a Design Pattern for a Problem:
I need to solve the following design problem in my [language] project: “[describe the design problem or scenario in detail e.g., how to allow multiple objects to be notified of state changes in another object without tight coupling]“.
Which design pattern(s) would be most suitable for addressing this? Explain your reasoning and provide a brief overview of how the chosen pattern(s) might be implemented in this context.

----------------------------------------------

Explain the Singleton Design Pattern in the context of Java:
The Singleton design pattern is a creational pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is commonly used when there should be a single point of control or when a single instance is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

Structure:
- The Singleton class has a private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside the class.
- The class maintains a private static instance variable that holds the single instance of the class.
  
----------------------------------------------

Apply a Design Pattern to Existing Code:
Review the following [language] code snippet:

[paste your code snippet]

Could I refactor this code to incorporate the “[design pattern name]” design pattern to achieve “[specific goal e.g., better modularity, increased flexibility, decoupling components]“?
If so, explain how and provide a refactored version of the code or highlight the key changes needed.
